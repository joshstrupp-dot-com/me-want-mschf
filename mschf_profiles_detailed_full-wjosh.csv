,,Josh Strupp,Writer & Creative Director • Data Analyst & Storyteller • Experience Designer • Average Dancer,"Brooklyn, NY",,"Creative professional with 10+ years of experience at the intersection of storytelling, design, and data.
I bring together a background in journalism, product design, data analysis, and copywriting to help brands communicate clearly and creatively—especially when the subject matter is complex.

I’ve worked across industries and formats for clients like National Geographic, the NHL, Planned Parenthood, and American Airlines—crafting editorial features, digital tools, data-driven experiences, and campaign platforms that connect.

I earned my B.A. in Journalism from The George Washington University (magna cum laude), and recently completed my M.S. in Data Visualization from Parsons School of Design, where I deepened my practice in visual storytelling, mapping, machine learning, and UX strategy.

Now, I’m focused on roles that blend editorial thinking, design leadership, and data-driven creativity—whether in newsroom innovation, creative tech, or product and brand storytelling.","1,576 followers","[

I consult businesses on how to make the most out of online commerce. They want exposure, leads, and sales. Together we determine what is involved and outline the roadmap to benchmark and achieve those goals. “It’s my hobby, it’s my job, it’s my passion.”

I’ve invested 20+ years in building websites, developing complex software, and helping small businesses and enterprise-level clients alike to improve search engine traffic and sales. This path allowed me to create and sell multiple web-based software programs and SEO-specific products. I’m proud that we have acquired utility patents for some of these products.

I've been afforded the pleasure numerous times to speak about online reputation management, black hat and white hat SEO practices at national conferences…and in some very cool places.

Some specialties I've acquired over the years are:

* creation and implementation of online business plans including development blueprints and revenue generation programs that display validity to private and public funding sources
* development of traffic acquisition programs
* experience in online IP and processes for domains and software as assets
* analytics of many forms and segway’s to/from traditional marketing

I developed novel partnerships with agencies Anomaly and Droga5; media brands Complex, New York magazine, Refinery29, and Vice; and institutional entities Onassis Foundation and Nokia Bell Labs. In 2019 I steered the New Museum and Apple partnership to bring augmented reality art walks to the public featuring commissions by artists Nick Cave, Cao Fei, John Giorno, and Pippilotti Rist.

3rd+ degree connection","TAXONOMY & RESEARCH
For over a decade I've worked in e-commerce focusing on two-sided user marketplaces with 50 million+ catalogs of unique items. I have previous experience in metadata in the fields of news, video, music, and cultural heritage. My taxonomies have been reported on in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Mad Money and recognized by the White House, as well as people everywhere who want pockets filters on dresses. Sometimes they're also a clue in the NYT crossword puzzle, and they're used daily in the distribution of news online.

I live for taxonomy development and metadata creation & normalization. Seriously, I think about this stuff when I am sorting my M&Ms by color.

My information research and interests are in knowledge organization, particularly classification systems, thesaurus construction, and taxonomies. I bring encyclopedic knowledge, a passion for research, and solutions for metadata organization & enrichment wherever I go. What I don't know, I find quickly with my super fine librarian skills.

I've written subject, geographical, product & entity taxonomies. I have years of experience in online media--both its creation & design.

I also have experience in information architecture, user navigation & user experience. I have worked in internet content creation & organization, web design, competitive intelligence, corporate research, online media, and librarianship.

I love the Internet. But even more I like making people happy with it. I want what your users want. As such, I do work in a lot of realms--taxonomy, ontology, data modeling, knowledge graphs, search, user experience & testing, viral social media, content creation, branding & lecturing on these subjects.

REMOTE MANAGEMENT
I have six years of experience building and managing remote workers and helping them be effective in a non-remote workplace. Building a remote department with a national reputation was a fun part of my last position. I love building remote teams, not just remote workers who work alone or are considered secondary workers. I especially love remote mentoring and career building, and hiring.
